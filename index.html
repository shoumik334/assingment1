                    is not simply random text. It has roots in
                    a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
                    making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock.</p>

            <h2>AIM</h2>
            <p>CMy aim in life has always been to become a successful 
                software engineer. Software engineering is highly respected
                 in the field of information technology as almost every field 
                 is associated with computers these days.

                The role of a software engineer becomes crucial in tapping 
                the available sources to provide the best solution for issues faced.
                
                Checking out the latest software upgrades has to be
                 considered as well. Software engineering will help me in realizing
                  my dream of making it big in the severe competition involved in the 
                  corporate market.
